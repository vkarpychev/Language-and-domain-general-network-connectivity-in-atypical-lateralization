Language comprehension and production are thought to be predominantly supported by the left-lateralized language-related network. However, right-hemispheric homologs of the language regions can also involve in language processing, resulting in atypical lateralization. Given that such recruitment might serve to maintain or improve the efficiency of language performance, it raises a question of whether domain-general networks, as non-language systems, can also engage in language processing in atypical lateralization. To investigate how the degree of lateralization in healthy adults relates to the engagement of domain-general networks and their connectivity to the LRN, we applied independent component analysis to task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging with sentence completion
